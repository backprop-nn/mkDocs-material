This is false in part. The case will be made below shortly. 1. Winners and losers have the same goals:     Every team that participate in a tournament have the same goal to win the world cup. But only one team does that. The winners and losers had the same goals, but only one succeeded. As they implemented a system of small improvements.    Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias. We concentrate on the people who end up winning - the survivors- and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the  people who had the same objective but didn't succeed. 2. Achieving a goal is only a momentary change(IMPORTANT):     Imagine we have a messy room and we set our goal to clean it. We summon the energy to finally to do clean it, and we clean it(after many rounds of procrastination). We've cleaned the room - for now. If we maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy room in the first place, we'll soon end up with a new set of mess. And we'll be looking for another round of incredible energy to clean the room. We're chasing the same outcome. Despite achieving the goal, we're again and again chasing the same goal. This is recurrent because we've never changed the system.     We've treated a symptom without addressing the cause.    We need to solve the problems at systems level-fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves. 3. Goals restrict our idea of happiness:    Goals create an \"either or\" conflict: If we achieve our goal we tell ourselves that we are successful, if we don't we treat ourselves as an utter disappointment.     When we adopt the system-first mentality we fall in love with the process rather than the outcome. We don't have to wait till the outcome is achieved to be happy.

This is the typical approach people have: GOAL(losing weight) -&gt; PROCESS(sticking to a diet) -&gt; OUTCOME(lean body).  If I do this process then I'll lose weight. They have their goals in place and their plans to act to progress in that direction.

You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason we'll stuck with one is that it becomes part if our identity.

If we keep casting the same vote we've always cast, we're going to get the same results we've always got. If nothing changes, nothing will change. The two-step process to change identity: 1. Decide the type of person you want to be.     First decide who you want to be. This holds at any level- as individual,team,society, nation. What do you stand for? What are your principals and values? Who do you wish to become?     Answering these from bottom-up is hard. It's easier to work top-bottom. Start with the type of results you want to achieve.And then work backwards.     Ex:     1. Who is the type of person that can get SIX-pack: The one who eats proper food and maintains calorie deficit.     2. Who is the type of person that is well-versed with DATA SCIENCE: The one who daily invests decent hours of his life to learning things in DS and writes code.
