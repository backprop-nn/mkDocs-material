Lot many words, a lot of non-intelligible words, a few familiar words, and very few words we actually understand and use. 

Communication is central to intelligence. Communicating is the display of intelligence. Communication boils down to words. Alphabets don’t make much sense when used alone. 

We suck at using words. Most of our vocabulary is similar to that of a 10th grader. After some time we hit a stagnation to learn words as we stand in the way of learning one when we see one.

My conjecture is that we try to understand the word by looking up for a familiar synonym instead of understanding the nuance.

Doing this gives us power—the power of articulating feelings and thoughts with great conviction. Our message will penetrate the depths of our psyche and the others who read it. Who actually read it.
